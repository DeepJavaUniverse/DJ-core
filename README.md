# DeepJava

Read this in other languages: [Русский](README.ru.md)

DeepJava (DJ) is a DeepLearning framework. One might ask: why do we need yet another DeepLearning framework? Good question. There is, at least, one thing that makes DJ different: it is, mainly, for the educational purpose. What does this mean exactly:

* Codebase should be understandable (not fast). Anyone who has read a book about DeepLearning should be able to map main concepts from the book to the code in this framework (if concept already implemented);
* You can experiment. Educational purpose means that the framework open for the experiments. Do you have an idea how to represent a computational graph in a non-canonical way? You can try it here!
* Simple to use. DJ prioritizing the simplicity over the speed, such priority would not be possible with other frameworks.
